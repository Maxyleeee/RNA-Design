# RNA Structure Generation

This directory contains tools and resources for generating and analyzing RNA secondary structures using Context-Free Grammars (CFG).

## Directory Structure

### Root
- `generate_structures.py`: Main Python script to generate random RNA secondary structures based on a weighted CFG. It supports different configurations for length and weights (unpaired vs. stack).
- `structure_design.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook documenting the design of the CFG and the generation process.
- `random_gen_RNA.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the generated structures and exploring the RNA structure space (counting states, etc.).

### tutorials/
Contains introductory notebooks on using the ViennaRNA package.
- `1_ViennaRNA_Introduction.ipynb`: Introduction to ViennaRNA.
- `2_Practical_Example.ipynb`: Practical examples using ViennaRNA.
(And their "No_Solution" counterparts for my own exercising purposes).

### output/
Contains the text files generated by `generate_structures.py`. Each file contains a list of dot-bracket representations of RNA structures.
- `generated_structures.txt`: Default output.
- `structures_*_L*.txt`: Structures generated with specific configurations (length, bias).
